This repository contains a simple web application for Iris classification using a Decision Tree Classifier. The Iris dataset is a popular benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning, consisting of measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) of three different Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica).
The provided web application demonstrates how to perform Iris classification using a pre-trained Decision Tree Classifier model.
